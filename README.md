# InGameCC mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl

This is a mini-update for the InGameCC mod (based on MrSeyker's adapted files for ZRP 1.07 R5RC).

You still need the original mod files that can be found here: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/bf55c3/using_ingame_closed_caption_mod_with_zrp_107_r5_rc/).
